# Assignment 2

Here is what I did:

- Refresh every 20 seconds
- Button for start/stop refreshing (text changes to "refreshing" while updating, hover to show original text)
- Fixed profile image error
- Used old-fashioned JQuery to bound events
- Instant search bar
- Fixed image blinking while typing (by hiding instead of deleting)
- Responsive font size for navigation bar.
